It’s the law.\\n  Edited by Emily McGarvey\\nAll times stated are UK\\nAlexandra Fouché\\nLive reporter\\nWe will be pausing our live coverage of events in Morocco shortly, thank you for joining us. \\nBefore we go, let\\'s take a look at what\\'s happened over the last few hours:\\nToday\\'s coverage was brought to you by our writers Ece Göksedef, Laurence Peter, Maria Zaccaro and Mattea Bubalo. We were also joined by our colleague Megan Fisher on the video desk. The page was edited by James FitzGerald, Henri Astier, Emily McGarvey and me.\\nYou can keep up to date with the latest news from Morocco with our news story here.\\nMore than 300,000 people in Marrakesh and its outskirts have been affected by the powerful earthquake that hit Morocco, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says.\\nIt said OCHA was \"closely monitoring the situation and stands ready to support\".\\nIn an earlier statement, the UN said it was ready to \"assist the government of Morocco in its efforts to assist the impacted population\".\\nNick Beake\\nReporting from Marrakesh\\nWe’re driving through the winding streets of the Old City, where there is rubble around many corners. \\nStreets are sealed off and the police are doing their best to manage the traffic, amid a cacophony of moped horns.\\nSome families pass us on foot - with their possessions piled up on shopping trolleys.\\nMany are now camping out in the open, including dozens resting on the grass outside the Royal Palace. \\nThey are fearful to return to their homes, with the prospect of more aftershocks.\\nOther parts of the city are though busy and bustling - with cafes full.\\nBut in many remote places - up into the Atlas Mountains - there will not be this semblance of normality, for it is in these communities where most have lost their lives.\\nThere will be three days of national mourning in Morocco after the overnight earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people, according to an announcement from the country\\'s royal palace.\\nThe decision follows a meeting discussing the disaster, chaired by King Mohamed VI.\\n\"Three days of national mourning have been decided, with flags to fly at half-mast on all public buildings,\" a statement published by the news agency MAP read.\\nThe armed forces will send rescue teams to affected areas to provide clean drinking water, food supplies, tents and blankets, it added.\\nMany people living in isolated villages around the High Atlas mountains, close to the quake\\'s epicentre, have lost loved ones. \\nLahcen is one of them, and he is inconsolable after losing his wife and four children in the disaster. \\n\"I\\'ve lost everything,\" he tells AFP. I can\\'t do anything right now, I just want to get away from the world and mourn.\"\\nGraves are being dug on a hill in the village to bury the dead. Hasna, another resident in the area, says \"the whole village is mourning its children\".\\n\"Many of my neighbours lost loved ones. The pain is indescribable.\" \\nThe response effort to the earthquake could take years due to the level of devastation, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has said.\\n“We are mobilising now to support the Moroccan Red Crescent,\" Hossam Elsharkawi, IFRC\\'s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa said.\\n\"This will not be a week or two of response... we are looking at many months if not years of response.” \\nCaroline Holt, operations director for the IFRC, said the next 24 to 48 hours will be critical in terms of saving lives.\\n\"Search and rescue efforts will be prioritised in parallel, of course, with making sure that those that we know have survived are taken care of,\" she said.\\nEarlier we heard from people in Morocco who have shared what they experienced when the quake struck last night.\\nMarrakesh resident Mina Metioui said that, in the city, the noise sounded like \"a fighter jet\", getting louder and louder.\\n\"The next thing I see, my room is moving, pictures, frames started falling off the wall,\" she told BBC News. \"You know, things just started dropping off. That\\'s when I realised we\\'re going through some sort of an earthquake.\\nMontasir Itri, who lives in the mountain village of Asni, close to the epicentre, told Reuters: \"Our neighbours are under the rubble and people are working hard to rescue them using available means in the village.\"\\nHouda Outassaf had been walking around Jemaa el-Fna Square in Marrakesh when he felt the ground start to shake.\\n\"I have at least 10 members of my family who died... I can hardly believe it, as I was with them no more than two days ago,\" he told AFP.\\nAdam Smith, 23, and his girlfriend, 22, from Sheffield, are on holiday in Marrakech. They’re due to fly home on Monday. He said the hotel they\\'re staying at was “shaken to the core” during the quake.\\n“We’re relatively safe now. Things are stable compared to last night,\" he told the BBC.\\nHe said initially it was very scary when the tremor first hit. \"We were winding down to go to sleep, the glass was vibrating, we grabbed some essential items and ran outside.\"\\nHe said they, along with other guests, were near the entrance of the hotel when the second tremor hit.\\n\"We desperately searched for English speakers but we only found a couple of people who spoke broken English. We waited to see if the building would be stable and eventually ran in to retrieve medication and bedding as we faced the prospect of sleeping in the car park for the evening.\"\\nHajar Chaffag\\nBBC Africa\\nChaimae, a Moroccan national residing in London, described her initial panic upon learning of the recent earthquake in Morocco.\\nThe majority of her relatives live in and around Rabat, the nation\\'s capital, prompting her to closely follow the situation.

It’s the law.\\n  Edited by Emily McGarvey\\nAll times stated are UK\\nAlexandra Fouché\\nLive reporter\\nWe will be pausing our live coverage of events in Morocco shortly, thank you for joining us. \\nBefore we go, let\\'s take a look at what\\'s happened over the last few hours:\\nToday\\'s coverage was brought to you by our writers Ece Göksedef, Laurence Peter, Maria Zaccaro and Mattea Bubalo. We were also joined by our colleague Megan Fisher on the video desk. The page was edited by James FitzGerald, Henri Astier, Emily McGarvey and me.\\nYou can keep up to date with the latest news from Morocco with our news story here.\\nMore than 300,000 people in Marrakesh and its outskirts have been affected by the powerful earthquake that hit Morocco, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says.\\nIt said OCHA was \"closely monitoring the situation and stands ready to support\".\\nIn an earlier statement, the UN said it was ready to \"assist the government of Morocco in its efforts to assist the impacted population\".\\nNick Beake\\nReporting from Marrakesh\\nWe’re driving through the winding streets of the Old City, where there is rubble around many corners. \\nStreets are sealed off and the police are doing their best to manage the traffic, amid a cacophony of moped horns.\\nSome families pass us on foot - with their possessions piled up on shopping trolleys.\\nMany are now camping out in the open, including dozens resting on the grass outside the Royal Palace. \\nThey are fearful to return to their homes, with the prospect of more aftershocks.\\nOther parts of the city are though busy and bustling - with cafes full.\\nBut in many remote places - up into the Atlas Mountains - there will not be this semblance of normality, for it is in these communities where most have lost their lives.\\nThere will be three days of national mourning in Morocco after the overnight earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people, according to an announcement from the country\\'s royal palace.\\nThe decision follows a meeting discussing the disaster, chaired by King Mohamed VI.\\n\"Three days of national mourning have been decided, with flags to fly at half-mast on all public buildings,\" a statement published by the news agency MAP read.\\nThe armed forces will send rescue teams to affected areas to provide clean drinking water, food supplies, tents and blankets, it added.\\nMany people living in isolated villages around the High Atlas mountains, close to the quake\\'s epicentre, have lost loved ones. \\nLahcen is one of them, and he is inconsolable after losing his wife and four children in the disaster. \\n\"I\\'ve lost everything,\" he tells AFP. I can\\'t do anything right now, I just want to get away from the world and mourn.\"\\nGraves are being dug on a hill in the village to bury the dead. Hasna, another resident in the area, says \"the whole village is mourning its children\".\\n\"Many of my neighbours lost loved ones. The pain is indescribable.\" \\nThe response effort to the earthquake could take years due to the level of devastation, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has said.\\n“We are mobilising now to support the Moroccan Red Crescent,\" Hossam Elsharkawi, IFRC\\'s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa said.\\n\"This will not be a week or two of response... we are looking at many months if not years of response.” \\nCaroline Holt, operations director for the IFRC, said the next 24 to 48 hours will be critical in terms of saving lives.\\n\"Search and rescue efforts will be prioritised in parallel, of course, with making sure that those that we know have survived are taken care of,\" she said.\\nEarlier we heard from people in Morocco who have shared what they experienced when the quake struck last night.\\nMarrakesh resident Mina Metioui said that, in the city, the noise sounded like \"a fighter jet\", getting louder and louder.\\n\"The next thing I see, my room is moving, pictures, frames started falling off the wall,\" she told BBC News. \"You know, things just started dropping off. That\\'s when I realised we\\'re going through some sort of an earthquake.\\nMontasir Itri, who lives in the mountain village of Asni, close to the epicentre, told Reuters: \"Our neighbours are under the rubble and people are working hard to rescue them using available means in the village.\"\\nHouda Outassaf had been walking around Jemaa el-Fna Square in Marrakesh when he felt the ground start to shake.\\n\"I have at least 10 members of my family who died... I can hardly believe it, as I was with them no more than two days ago,\" he told AFP.\\nAdam Smith, 23, and his girlfriend, 22, from Sheffield, are on holiday in Marrakech. They’re due to fly home on Monday. He said the hotel they\\'re staying at was “shaken to the core” during the quake.\\n“We’re relatively safe now. Things are stable compared to last night,\" he told the BBC.\\nHe said initially it was very scary when the tremor first hit. \"We were winding down to go to sleep, the glass was vibrating, we grabbed some essential items and ran outside.\"\\nHe said they, along with other guests, were near the entrance of the hotel when the second tremor hit.\\n\"We desperately searched for English speakers but we only found a couple of people who spoke broken English. We waited to see if the building would be stable and eventually ran in to retrieve medication and bedding as we faced the prospect of sleeping in the car park for the evening.\"\\nHajar Chaffag\\nBBC Africa\\nChaimae, a Moroccan national residing in London, described her initial panic upon learning of the recent earthquake in Morocco.\\nThe majority of her relatives live in and around Rabat, the nation\\'s capital, prompting her to closely follow the situation.
